What is the Three-Body Problem?

The three-body problem is a classic physics challenge that explores how three objects—like planets or stars—move under their mutual gravitational pull. While the motion of two bodies (like Earth and the Sun) can be precisely predicted, adding just one more object makes the system incredibly complex and unpredictable.

This problem highlights the fascinating nature of chaotic systems, where tiny differences in starting conditions can lead to wildly different outcomes. It’s fundamental in fields from astrophysics to space mission planning and remains a key example of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory.

Understanding and simulating the three-body problem helps us better grasp the complexities of our universe—and pushes the boundaries of physics and mathematics.
